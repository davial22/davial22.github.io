Hi My name is david luiciano and i go to Inwood early college for health and technologies which is located in dyckman New york.
My  long term goal right now is to focus on criminbology to help protect my community since there is alot of issues going on
throughout New York City. Currently, in inwood early college, i am focusing on being an entrepeneur to make it out of New York City by trying my best in all of my
classses and focusing on each of them very well to insure that People see me and want me on the job. ON my personal time i like to make music, play basketball with my friends or even on my 
own , i also like cooking and making up new recipes etc.
