# Reflection - Professional Portfolio
## David Luciano
I would describe this portfolio as impactful. This is my opinion because I learned how to code things that can be used for my future career. I had a bit of fun with the coding because I was decorating the project. The purpose of this portfolio is to teach us how to code and it teaches us how to make websites and digital porfolios by using html and css style sheets. <br> In the beginning of me doing my portfolio, it was unprofessional and not easy.
